# Todoist Lite

Official submission to `18CSE302J - Fullstack Development with MERN` at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, under the guidance of `Dr. N. Parthiban`.

## About

The project is a simple CRUD Application built using MERN Stack that allows user to add new tasks, update existing tasks and delete the same. It consists of an API built using Node.js and Express.js which connects to a MongoDB Atlas Database to handle the entries. 

## Tech Stack and Dependencies

### Server
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - MongoDB Atlas
 - body-parser
 - cors
 - mongoose
 - nodemon

### Frontend
 - React
 - CSS

## Softwares Used

1. Visual Studio Code (Primary IDE)
2. Node and npm
3. Postman

## Accessing the API

The application is deployed locally, hence in order to access the API, we need to provision the `localhost` URL followed by the `tasks` route. The endpoint of the API resembles the following:

`http://localhost:4000/tasks`
